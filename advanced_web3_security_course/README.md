# Advanced Web3 Security Course

## Smart Contract Design

1. The less code, the less bugs
2. Be extremely picky about creating storage variables
3. How much of the logic of my contract can be done off-chain?
4. Avoid for loops as much as possible (where you can run out of gas)
5. Limit expected inputs (disallow inputs that shouldn't be allowed)
6. Handle all cases (i.e. what if the keeper/oracle goes down?)
7. Parallel data structures (avoid having 2 pieces of state tracking the same thing)
