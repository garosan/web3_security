- Worked at a hedge fund for several years.
- Got dissilusioned with how the whole thing works for regular people (basically someone making random decisions of number goes up, number goes down)
- Looked for a way to make it more fair for regular people (less information assymetry)

How would you recommend devs to learn the finance and DeFi side of blockchain?

Patrick: The biggest use case of blockchain rn is money, DeFi. But don't overthink it, don't get intimidated.

First understand personal finance: Index funds, etc.

Book recommendation: I will teach you to be rich. But it's a book on basics of personal finance:

Then Patrick worked as a dev advocate for Chainlink for 2.5 years aprox.

How is a dev advocate successful? Know, use and love.

- Teach what the product does
- Help people use it and integrate with it
- Take it to the point people love the product

At time of recording, around 50k active Solidity devs.

Andy asks what was the most difficult thing jumping from finnance into web3?

Patrick says he hated everything was in javascript and Solidity tutorials were very outdated.

"Get comfortable with being uncomfortable."

Foundry's step through debugger to go EVM code by EVM code.

Andy asks what's a good area to focus on between developing, auditing and ZK?

Patrick says governance is overlooked. The current model:

- People launch a DeFi protocol
- They need to monetize
- They launch a token
- SEC eyes on them, they say 'oh its a governance token'
- They dump it
- Ppl get scammed

Governance by plutocracy is not good. Patrick advocates for researching alternatives.

For security, learn Huff, try to make small smart contracts in Huff

- Learn Uniswap front to back
- Learn AAVE front to back

Andy says you can jump straight into auditing by:

- Learning just enough Solidity
- Doing some CTF challenges
- Really really learning DeFi protocol inner workings front to back

### Patrick's auditing process

- Understand from a high level what the protocol's supposed to do
- Go through the functions and understand them high level
- Go through the public functions that are meant to interact with the users
- Then go again line by line and look for bugs

Patrick left Chainlink around jan 2023.
