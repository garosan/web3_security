First, you've done the work:

This is not going to be easy, but it is very possible.

1. Why I dont like contests as an income source
2. How audits are a time-specific product
3. A high-level process to go from 0 to 1
4. What he would do if he had to start from 0 again

## 1. Why I dont like contests as an income source

They put you in a commoditized position, you're easily replaceable or too much competition.

You want a brand that compounds, focus on personal brand.

## 2. How audits are a time-specific product

Adopt an inbound sales process. Be prepared for clients to come to you when they need your product instead of you reaching for them.

## 3. A high-level process to go from 0 to 1

Nurture a relationship with the protocol, provide value first.
Provide a free basic review of their protocol for example.
Build out your network.

## 4. What he would do if he had to start from 0 again
