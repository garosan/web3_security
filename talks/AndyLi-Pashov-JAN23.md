# Private Audits, Obtaining Clients and Navigating the World of Independent Security Research

Working 12hr days is kind of a meme, somewhat true.

- Pashov started doing Java development.
- Spent a year learning Solidity, reading books writing code until he got a job.
- Spent 6,7 months at a blockchain development job
- Got laid off and decided to go full into web3 security
- Apparently this happened recently and Pashov in Jan 2023 says he might have had to look for a job because he was running out money, but also says auditing is really taking off for him

His process for finding a HIGH was started to read a ton but a ton of reports.
He also mentions he probably got lucky that the codebase was very junior and full of errors.

Don't start by reading the highs and mediums in the reports bcs you're gonna feel overwhelmed.

## About being smart with your time

Don't read the code before the reports.
Start with the gas optimizations and lows.

If someone is putting 10hrs a day, they WILL see progress.
If someone is not making progress its because they're not putting in the hours.
If it bores you, try something different.

2 months can make a crazy big difference:

- Pashov's case 1st solo audit got paid 3 digits.
- 2 months later he's doing A LOT MORE.

Pashov joined Spearbit, finally accepted in xmas 2022.
Very hard process. Tier 1 company.

Spearbit pays really well, pays like 20k for lead researchers.
20k per week!!!! when you're on an audit.

A regular SR (not junior not lead) gets paid like 12k/week during audits.

## How beginners should approach code4rena

When Pashov and Andy Li started they would get hundreds of dollars for lows, thousands of dlls for mediums, now these are all very well known and they pay cents.

"You have to pay the price for being late to the party."

## An algo for success

Read the latest reports in Code4rena, copy from them, make your report look damn good!

## Balance between work and study

Every day is different. Most days he puts in 8/10hrs, and try to balance research and auditing.

If you don't practice what you're studying you'll just forget it.
